[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) in Rust.

This is some of the first Rust I've written, so don't expect particularly good code.

Each day has its own directory, but the organisation of part1/part2 is an on ad-hoc basis
(sometimes multiple files, sometimes multiple functions, etc).

The code should be in a compiling state for part2, and will need manual tweaks to revert it
to working for part1.
